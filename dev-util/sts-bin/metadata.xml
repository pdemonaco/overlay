	 The tool suites provide ready-to-use combinations of language support, framework
	 support, and runtime support, and combine them with the existing Java, Web and
	 Java EE tooling from Eclipse. An integrated dashboard in the distribution
	 makes it trivial to install further extensions that add support for technologies 
	 such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Gradle or Pivotal tcServer.
